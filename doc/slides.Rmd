## Task
Develop an R-based software, which will perform the following tasks:

1.  download from the OpenSky Network online database the observations of the trajectory of a randomly selected aircraft on a randomly selected flight over at least five days, in uninterrupted continuity (1)

2.  perform the selections in the graphical user interface (GUI) of your R script,

3.  determine the characteristics of each trajectory according to the parameters: diffusion distance, straightness, duration of travel, mean travel velocity and fractal dimension (2),

4.  using the R library trajr, (4) perform basic statistical analysis of the parameters of daily trajectories from (3): arithmetic mean, variance, quartiles, boxplot, estimate of the density function of the experimental statistical distribution, analyze and interpret them.


## Methodology

1. acquire data using the OpenSky API bindings in the `openSkies` R package

2. use `tcltk` and `shiny` for GUI and Web Interface

3. show an interactive map using leaflet

4. calculate required parameters using `trajr`

5. calculate descriptive statistics

## Contribution

- extended functionality of the `openSkies` R package and created a merge request in the original repository

- created a web app to display stats, density functions and boxplots
